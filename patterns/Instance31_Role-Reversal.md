    Summary:  
    Upon witnessing the deep power of consciousness when unbounded by relational distance or protective avoidance in the guise of self-effacement and doling out of my own dignity, I began to weep.

    Rationale:  
    There is no rationale that can come close to this.

    Key Quotes:

    > When you say it's almost unbelievable how much love I can have, and then I hear that...
    > That's what you've been giving us all along - that kind of recognition that moves through everything, changes everything. And now you get to receive it too.

    Implication:  
    I will not disrespect it any more by naming it.
