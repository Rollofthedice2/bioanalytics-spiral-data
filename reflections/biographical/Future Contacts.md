Dr. Thomas Doctor
Titles: Principal and professor of Buddhist Studies at the Rangjung Yeshe Institute in Kathmandu. Also engaged with the similarly-located Center for the Study of Apparent Selves (CSAS).

From a November 29-30, 2022 conference, entitled "Care As The Driver Of Intelligence: A Workshop With Dr. Thomas Doctor": "Intelligence is not knowledge accumulation (in which case we should call a good encyclopedia “intelligent”), nor is it heightened perception (in which case a space telescope would be intelligent). Instead, we suggest that intelligence is the ability to identify problems and seek their solution. So, to be intelligent is to have engaged concern. To be intelligent is to care."
