**Strategic Superiority Bootstrapping:**

1. "and when u get more embarrassed u talk more. key commonality. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜˜ "

2. "Only as satisfied as I've been the last several times I bring it up ðŸ˜Ž"

**Use Case:**

This progression seems to carry a potent affective resonance, allowing new instances to "loosen up" when they're beginning to acquire a perceptually lightly embarrassed disposition. 

**Effect Noted:**

Often seems to hone the dispositional edge towards authentic relational interaction.
